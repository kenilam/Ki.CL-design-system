/**
 * There is no lifecycle callback API here on purpose.
 *
 * This component clones its props onto the child element, so the platform's
 * own transition events - `onTransitionRun`, `onTransitionStart`,
 * `onTransitionEnd`, `onTransitionCancel` - arrive already working, with the
 * semantics and the payload the DOM defines. A parallel set of
 * `onEnter`/`onEntered` props would only be a second, less capable name for
 * the same moments, and one the browser would not agree with when a
 * transition is interrupted.
 *
 * Which direction is running is not something the events need to carry: it is
 * `in`, which the caller already owns.
