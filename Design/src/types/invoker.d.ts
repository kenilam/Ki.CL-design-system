/**
 * Invoker commands, until the React types carry them.
 *
 * `commandfor` points a button at another element by id and `command` says what
 * to do to it, so a dialog opens and closes from markup alone - no state, no
 * handler, no ref. The attributes ship in the browser already; what is missing
 * is only the typing, and it is missing in the newest published
 * `@types/react` (19.2.18) as well as the one installed here, so upgrading does
 * not supply it.
 *
 * Delete this file when DefinitelyTyped lands them.
